Title: Looking for a deli or food cart that is within a given area
Theme: general, food, transportation
Abstract: sometimes it's hard to find a place to eat for cheap. So why not find where all foodcards/delis are and see which one is closer. That is, if I finish the coding that is.
Relevance to NYC: Everyone in the city has thought about going to a bodega or a food cart.
